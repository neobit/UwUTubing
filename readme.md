## About The Project
---

Hi Senpai!! UwUTubing is a simple software made in Python to help you download your favorite media from Youtube. Using the link of the youtube video you want to download in the program and defining the location of your computer you can download as many videos as you want. >__<

Why download videos from youtube?:
* You can save your favorite contents without depending on the stability of youtube to keep the videos or not.
* You keep your media saved to use even when you don't have internet.
* Simply download cause you can... Senpai. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

Although I don't believe in senpai intellectual property... the purpose of this software is not to facilitate distribution of pirated material. Use with caution, I don't want to see you in trouble. ／(˃ᆺ˂)＼
